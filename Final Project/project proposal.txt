For my final project, I will be loonngat cencus data to see data on individuals and households that identify as disabled.   I want to look at the demographics, income, and employment status on these households/individuals and compare that data to those who do not identify as disabled.  I would be interested to see how this data has shifted in recent years, specifically since the start of the pandemic in 2020.  As the pandemic continues, I have heard that it is expected that there will be an increase in disability rates, and I am interested in seeing numbers around this to see if this is already supported, and if there are certain demographics or income levels that appear to be more impacted.  This infomation will not necessarily point to covid as being th cause, but I'm curious to see if the information I find will give some indication that covid is playing a factor in the numbers, if there is any shift in these rates at all.
